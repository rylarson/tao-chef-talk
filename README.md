# TAO Chef Talk Slide Deck

These are the demo slides.  Go  [here](http://rylarson.github.io/tao-chef-talk) to see a live version of the slides.

The slides are displayed using the [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) framework, and stored in [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.0/user/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), which is stored in a branch named "gh-pages".

## In order to edit the demo

  * New slides (left-to-right transition) are specified by "--new-slide--" at the beginning of a line
